# Privacy Policy — SkillBridge for Anthropic Academy

**Last updated:** March 5, 2026

## Overview

SkillBridge is a browser extension that translates [Anthropic Academy](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/) course pages into 30+ languages. It is designed with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

**SkillBridge does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

## How Translation Works

All translation processing happens **entirely within your browser**:

- **Google Translate API** — Page text is sent to Google's public translation endpoint and the translated result is returned directly to your browser. No data passes through any SkillBridge-owned server.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash (via Puter.js)** — Used for inline HTML tag preservation and quality verification of complex sentences. Requests are routed through [Puter.js](https://docs.puter.com/), a third-party client-side AI gateway. SkillBridge does not operate or control Puter.js servers.
- **Claude Sonnet 4 (via Puter.js)** — Powers the AI Tutor sidebar chatbot. Requests are routed through Puter.js. SkillBridge does not operate or control Puter.js servers.
- **Curated dictionaries** — 560+ hand-curated terms per premium language are stored locally within the extension package.
- **Translation cache (IndexedDB)** — Previously translated text is cached locally in your browser's IndexedDB to improve performance. This data never leaves your device.
